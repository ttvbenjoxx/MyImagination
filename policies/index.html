            <li>Ensure the integrity and security of user accounts</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>3. Cookies and Local Storage</h3>
            <p>
              MyImagination does not use cookies or any third-party trackers.
              <br /><br />
              To support a seamless experience, this site uses local storage to
              retain user session data. This ensures that users remain signed in
              between visits. Only essential, non-sensitive data related to login
              status is stored locally.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h3>
          <p>
            User data is never sold, rented, or shared with third parties.
            Information collected is used strictly for the purpose of enabling
            account access and forum functionality.
            <br /><br />
            No external tools or integrations are used for analytics or
            advertising.
          </p>

          <h3>5. User Control and Data Access</h3>
          <p>
            Users may request access to or deletion of their account and associated
            personal data by contacting
            <a href="mailto:gmolter@ftstudent.org">gmolter@ftstudent.org</a>.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Note:</strong> Deleting an account does not remove posts,
            comments, or replies made on the forum. To request removal of specific
            content, users must complete the <em>Post Deletion Request</em> found
            on Page 2 of the MyImagination Issue Report Form, available
            <a href="https://forms.gle/z9MtK3tS1TS1JhK4A" target="_blank">here</a>.
            All requests are reviewed and processed within a reasonable timeframe.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            Appropriate security measures, including HTTPS encryption and secure
            session handling, are in place to protect user information. No password
            data is collected or stored, minimizing the risk of credential-based
            threats.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Policy Updates</h3>
          <p>
            This policy may be updated from time to time to reflect platform
            changes or legal requirements. All updates will be posted on this page.
            Continued use of the site after any policy update constitutes
            acceptance of the revised terms.
