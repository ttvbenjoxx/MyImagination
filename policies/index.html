            Welcome to MyImagination (“the Site”), developed and administered by a
            team (“we,” “our,” or “the Admin Team”), led by Gavin Molter. These
            Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Site as well as any
            child or subsites created or operated by the Admin/Development Team of
            MyImagination. 
            <strong>
              By creating an account or otherwise using the Site, you confirm that
              you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms, our
              <a href="#privacyPanel" class="internal-link" data-target="privacyTitle">
                Privacy Policy
              </a>
              and
              <a href="#cookiePanel" class="internal-link" data-target="cookieTitle">
                Cookie Policy
              </a>.
            </strong>
            If you do not agree with any provision of these Terms, you must
            discontinue use of the Site immediately and contact
            <a href="mailto:gmolter@ftstudent.org">gmolter@ftstudent.org</a>
            for the deletion of your MyImagination account.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Purpose and Non-Affiliation</h3>
          <p>
            MyImagination serves as a platform for teachers, students, and other
            users to share website ideas that may enhance quality of life (QoL) for
            educational communities or personal use. We are not affiliated with
            Franklin Central Community School Corporation (“FTCSC”) or any of its
            schools, including Franklin Central High School. References to teaching
            or education are solely for the purpose of idea sharing and do not
            imply any official endorsement.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Eligibility and Account Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            By using the Site, you represent that you are at least 13 years of age.
            If you are under this age, you may not use MyImagination without
            explicit permission from a parent or guardian over the age of 18. To
            post ideas, comments, or otherwise engage with the Site, you must
            continue with an account using the chosen sign-in method.
          </p>

          <h3>3. User-Generated Content</h3>
          <p>
            You retain ownership of any original ideas or content (“User Content”)
            you post on MyImagination. By submitting User Content, you grant the
            Admin Team a non-exclusive, worldwide license to display, host, and
            share that content within the Site. Posting an idea does not obligate
            the Admin Team to develop or implement it. If the Admin/Development
            Team chooses to implement a user-submitted idea, the user who created
            that idea will receive no reimbursement or compensation, and forfeits
            any further claim to possession or ownership of that idea.
          </p>

          <h3>4. No Liability</h3>
          <p>
            We make no warranties regarding the Site’s functionality, reliability,
            or availability. Neither the Site nor its developer(s), Admin Team, or
            any affiliated parties shall be liable for any direct, indirect,
            incidental, consequential, or special damages arising out of or in
            connection with your use of the Site, your reliance on User Content, or
            any other matter relating to MyImagination or its child/subsites.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Changes to These Terms</h3>
          <p>
            We may revise or update these Terms at any time. Any modifications will
            be posted on this page. Continued use of the Site after changes are
            posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
          </p>

        <div class="policy-panel" id="privacyPanel" style="display: none;">
          <h2 id="privacyTitle" class="policy-title">MyImagination Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 3/22/2024</p>

          <p>
            This Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy (“Policy”) explains how MyImagination
            (“the Site”) collects, uses, and protects user data. By accessing or
            using the Site, you agree to the practices described in this Policy. If
            you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Site and contact
            <a href="mailto:gmolter@ftstudent.org">gmolter@ftstudent.org</a>
            to request account deletion.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Information Collected</h3>
          <p>
            MyImagination uses a third-party sign-in service for authentication.
            When you sign in, we collect the following basic profile information:
            <ul>
              <li>Name</li>
              <li>Email Address</li>
            </ul>
            We do not collect or store passwords; all password handling is managed
            by the third-party sign-in provider.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Use of Information</h3>
          <p>
            The collected information is used exclusively to authenticate your
            identity, display your details on forum content, maintain user access
            and session stability, and ensure account integrity. No data is used
            for advertising, analytics, or personalized marketing.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Cookies and Local Storage</h3>
          <p>
            MyImagination does not utilize traditional browser cookies or
            third-party trackers. We rely on local storage for essential
            non-sensitive login status data to keep you signed in between visits.
            For more details, see our
            <a
              href="#cookiePanel"
              class="internal-link"
              data-target="cookieTitle"
              >Cookie Policy</a
            >.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h3>
          <p>
            MyImagination does not sell, rent, or share user data with third
            parties. No external tools or integrations are employed for analytics,
            advertising, or any other data-processing activities.
          </p>

          <h3>5. User Control and Data Access</h3>
          <p>
            You may request access to or deletion of your MyImagination account and
            associated personal data by contacting
            <a href="mailto:gmolter@ftstudent.org">gmolter@ftstudent.org</a>. Note
            that deleting your account does not automatically remove posts or
            comments you have made. To request removal of specific content, please
            complete the Post Deletion Request found on Page 2 of the MyImagination
            Issue Report Form,
            <a href="https://forms.gle/z9MtK3tS1TS1JhK4A" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Unauthorized Access &amp; Third-Party Sign-In</h3>
          <p>
            Because MyImagination relies on a third-party sign-in service, any
            unauthorized access to your account or the consequences thereof are the
            responsibility of that third-party provider, not MyImagination.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Policy Updates</h3>
          <p>
            This Policy may be updated periodically to reflect platform changes or
            evolving requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page.
            Continued use of the Site after any Policy update constitutes
            acceptance of the revised terms.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Contact Information</h3>
